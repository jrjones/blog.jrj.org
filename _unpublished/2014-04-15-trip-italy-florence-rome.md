My wife and I recently returned from a trip to Italy, and I needed a place to share all the photos and a brief summary of the trip with family and friends.

We flew into Rome's <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rome-airport.info%2F&amp;ei=N19MU5GVG4buyAH4noFg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHLonYNcFxG8EV6M_3pfYAxZH5vqA&amp;sig2=0SV-x_PXHHIStTsfSFuBlg&amp;bvm=bv.64764171,d.aWc" target="_blank">Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino airport</a>, and caught a train to Florence. The flight (via Delta Air) was uneventful, but the food was really quite good.

Once we made it to the train station in Florence, we caught a cab to <a href="http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p3001507#summary" target="_blank">the apartment we had rented</a> for our stay in Firenze. The place was amazing - built in the late 1500s by Cosimo di Medici for the artist Giambologna, who lived and worked there for the first decade of the 1600s. It was literally 500 meters from the Duomo, and had been beautifully restored, including several original frescoes (and a few new ones to match the style.)

We met up with my cousin who is studying abroad in Florence, and the four of us had an absolutely incredible dinner at a ristorante literally a block away from the apartment, including some amazing local delicacies.

Exhausted, we went to bed early so we could get up at a reasonable hour to do some exploring. First, we had a couple of issues to deal with. 1.) Rachel's glasses had broken on the plane, and she didn't have enough contact lenses to get through the trip; we needed to get her new glasses. Second, Rachel's mom had hurt her hip, making it impossible for her to do all the walking and standing that we'd be doing on the trip; we had to rent a wheelchair.  We managed to knock both of these off in the morning, and get back in time for an early lunch.

We hit a pizzeria between our apartment and the Duomo, and had a great meal.

We headed to the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze museum (Academy of Fine Arts, Florence) which is where Michelangelo's David stands, as well as his stunning "Prisoners" which art historians classify as "unfinished." However, given that Michelangelo believed that the statues already existed and it was his job to chip away the marble to reveal them, I like to think that the Prisoners are exactly as he wanted them to be: showing the statues escaping their marble prisons. The museum was stunning in both quantity and quality of the art shown. Absolutely world-class. I'd put it in the same class as the Louvre in Paris any day.

After the Accademia, we headed to the Museo di Leonardo DaVinci, which was amazing. unfortunately, it was fairly dark, so many of my photos didn't come out as well as I would have liked. However, the museum had full-size implementations of many of the devices Leonardo only conceptualized and drew. The one below is of <a href="http://www.da-vinci-inventions.com/armoured-car.aspx" target="_blank">Leonardo's Tank/Armored Car</a>, which was amazing.

Even though the Museo di Leonardo is a commercial museum rather than a state-run enterprise, I can definitely recommend it - it's a great time, and the level of interactivity would make it great for kids. Amazing to see what this one man accomplished in his life.
