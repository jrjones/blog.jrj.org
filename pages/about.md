My name is Joseph R. Jones (AKA “JRJ”) and I’m a **Principal Product Manager** working in [**Adobe’s Primetime Video**](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/primetime.html) team where I'm responsible for Security (cryptography, incident and vulnerability management, compliance and audits, etc.) and **Video Compression Technologies**.

I live with my wife **Rachel** and my dog Loki in Pleasant Grove, UT (I was raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, and spent most of my adult life in Seattle.)

Prior to Adobe, I worked at [**Microsoft**](http://microsoft.com) on security, cryptography, and incident response for products ranging from Windows to XBox. Before that, I worked in a staggering number of startups: some wildly successful, some dismal failures, all were a blast!

**This site is my personal blog.** It’s primarily about technology and the future, and security/privacy. However, since this is a personal blog I reserve the right to stray from these topics on a regular basis… basically whatever I’m passionate about at the moment that isn’t related to my work. (Also, since it’s a personal blog **the opinions expressed are my own**, and any resemblance they may have to my employer’s is purely coincidental.)

I post infrequently, typically a couple times a month. To be sure to receive the latest, you can subscribe via RSS.
