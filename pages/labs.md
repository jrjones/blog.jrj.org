Coming in early 2016 I'll be sharing more on personal development projects. I create a lot of random scripts that might be useful to others, and I'm working on some larger projects that I'm looking forward to sharing. 

The first project will be "[Dev Simulator][1]," which is a simple but fun VR game/experience coming in Q1-2016.

In the mean-time, check out my [GitHub](http://github.jrj.org) and [YouTube](http://youtube.jrj.org) profiles.

Also, there's [a recent talk I gave about Immersive Technologies][2].

To be clear: jrjLabs is not a business, not a company, and will not be selling stuff. It's purely a place to share stuff (for free) that I'm working on.
