<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/opinion/free-speech-for-computers.html?" target="_blank">This opinion piece from the New York Times</a> introduces the first of what will be many related philosophical questions in future decades... **the rights of non-human persons**. I'm not talking about corporations, but *artificial* persons... specifically, **artificial intelligence**. This is not a completely abstract concept-- think of it not in the context of some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/055338256X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jrj.org-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=055338256X" target="_blank">Asimovian robot AI</a>, but rather in the context of a set of Google search results, which were generated by a surprisingly advanced example of artificial intelligence. **Censoring those results imposes the censorship on an AI, not a person. **Another relevant example would be expert systems, and IBM's successor to them, <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.html" target="_blank">Watson</a>. Censorship is a non-issue when it's answering Jeopardy questions, but <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/watson-for-a-smarter-planet/index.html" target="_blank">when it starts doing real work</a> it could be a problem.

Interesting question, and one that will need to be answered in the next few years. **Do computers have the right to free speech** in the same way that people do? More proximate: **Do you limit your own free speech rights when your method of communication is a computer? **
