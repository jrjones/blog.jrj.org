## Jekyll Static Site Generator
This site is built using the [Jekyll blog-aware static site engine](https://jekyllrb.com/), which allows me to maintain a directory full of .markdown files with all the posts and content, and generate a directory full of static files that can then be hosted anywhere. I highly recommend Jekyll, it's easy to use (if a bit geeky) and deceptively powerful.

I use several Jekyll plug-ins:
 - jekyll-pagination
 - jekyll-redirection
 - jekyll-tag-cloud
 
 I've also created a few of my own, which I may release at some point (mostly around category and tag handling, wordpress import clean-up, and CDN friendliness.) 

## "Feeling Responsive" Template
The current layout/template is a slightly customized version of <a href="https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/" target="_blank">Feeling Responsive theme by Phlow</a> (with more customizations on the way.) I chose this theme because it was simple and typography-centric, optimized for performance, and provided the hooks I needed for more advanced customizations. (Once I have a few of my customizations stabilized, I'll be doing a pull request to offer them back to the original theme creator-- especially the specialized post types that I use.) 

## Hosting
The static pages generated by Jekyll are then hosted in an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) container as origin, and served using Amazon's [CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for performance across geographies.

The site's content was migrated from an old WordPress installation, which itself included posts migrated from a variety of blog platforms dating back to 2002. Hence, the newer the post the more likely it is to match what was originally posted. I've tried to pull forward images and other assets, but most of the non-textual content that's more than 5 years old or so is gone.

## Typography
I'm still working on finazling the typography. My goal is readability first, followed by aeststetics. 

### Body text: Lato (sans serif)

[Lato](www.latofonts.com) is a sans-serif typeface family created in 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic. (*Lato* means "Summer" in Polish.) The semi-rounded details of the characters give Lato a sense of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz. 


<div style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 2em; background-color: silver; border-left: solid 3px black; padding: 1em;">A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 </div>

### Headlines: Volkhov  

[Volkhov](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Volkhov) is a low-contrast serif typeface, designed for readibility. Volkhov was designed by Ivan Petrov, and is available for free through Google.

<div style="font-family: Volkhov; font-size: 2em; background-color: silver; border-left: solid 3px black; padding: 1em;">A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 </div>

## Modular Scale

I have been playing a bit with relative sizes and the responsive layouts and scale. The site's base template, *Feeling Responsive*, explores the *2:3 perfect fifth* modular scale created with [www.modular-scale.com][7]. This is the modular scale of  *Feeling Responsive* which I have made only minor modifications to because it works so well.;

44px @ 1:1.5 – Ideal text size  
16px @ 1:1.5 – Important number

| Modular Scale

44.000 | 1     | 2.75  | 338.462
