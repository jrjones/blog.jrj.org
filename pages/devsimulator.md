Coming in early 2016: Dev Simulator is a silly VR game/experience that allows you to experience what it's like to be a software developer without all that pesky learning to code. Full of inside jokes and references, it should be fun... but it's first and foremost a learning project for me.

Dev Simulator will be released free[^1] on the following platforms (in descending order of experience quality.)

1. PC/Windows for Oculus Rift (late March 2016)
2. Android for Samsung Gear VR (Q1-2016)
3. Android and iOS for Google Cardboard (Q1-2016)

I may do a version for the HTC Vive early in the 2nd half of 2016 if a.) there's demand, and b.) I can get ahold of a devkit.

I'll release more information here as soon as I get close to a beta. (If you have a DK2 let me know and I can send you a tech demo you can check out.)

[^1]: The game will be free, and will have no in-app purchases. I'd like to open-source Dev Simulator, but I'm not sure if I can do that because I am using some assets that aren't open source. At minimum, I'll make all or most of the code I write available, but it's unlikely I'll be able to provide a buildable project.
