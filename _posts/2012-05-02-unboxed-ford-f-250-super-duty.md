Rach and I are buying an RV (well, actually we've already bought the fifth wheel RV, but we don't get to pick it up for a while because it's being custom-built.) Consequently, we needed a truck capable of towing a pretty hefty trailer. I did tons of research, and decided to get the <a href="http://www.ford.com/trucks/superduty/" target="_blank">Ford F-250 Super Duty</a> because it was the most quiet and comfortable, had the <a href="http://www.ford.com/syncmyride/" target="_blank">best iPod/iPhone integration</a>, and I liked the <a href="http://www.ford.com/trucks/superduty/features/#page=Feature18" target="_blank">factory fifth wheel hitch readiness</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/trucks/superduty/features/#page=Feature22" target="_blank">trailer brake control</a>, and <a href="http://www.ford.com/trucks/superduty/features/Feature16" target="_blank">trailer sway control</a> functionality.

We got the <a href="http://www.ford.com/trucks/superduty/features/#page=Feature1" target="_blank">6.7 liter PowerStroke diesel</a> because we didn't want to be underpowered towing a load on mountain roads,Â and this thing is a real beast of burden with 800 pound-feet of torque.

I would have liked to go with a smaller truck, but the F-150, even maxed out with all the options, wouldn't have been up to the task of towing the RV we're getting-- if we loaded the trailer to its capacity, plus full water, propane, fuel tanks, passengers, etc. we would have been over the CGVW rating-- we had to go with a Super Duty. It's huge, but quite comfortable. I mentioned earlier that it's quiet-- it's stunning, particularly for a diesel. <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2012-chevrolet-silverado-2500-ltz-4wd-crew-cab-vs-2012-ford-f-250-super-duty-king-ranch-4x4-crew-cab-2012-ram-2500-laramie-longhorn-4x4-mega-cab-comparison-tests-2012-ford-f-250-super-duty-king-ranch-4x4-crew-cab-page-3" target="_blank">Car and Driver recently noted that it's quieter at 70mph and at full throttle than the last Lexus ES350 they tested</a>.
