## Lato – A Sans Serif Typeface Family

[<dfn>Lato</dfn>][4] is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic. »Lato« means »Summer« in Polish. In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google. 

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz. Learn more at [www.latofonts.com][6]

#### Heading in Volkhov &lt;h4&gt;

As a four-weight family it is well-suited for complex text environments being economic and legible, contemporary and prominent. Many of its design solutions relate to this purpose: large open counters, rather short descenders, and brutal asymmetric serifs.

##### Heading in Volkhov &lt;h5&gt;

Spacing in Bold is slightly increased compared to the normal weight, because the bold mass is mostly grown inwards. The Italic has a steep angle and a distinctive calligraphically reminiscent character, as a counterpart to the rigorous Regular.
