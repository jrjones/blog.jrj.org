My name is Joseph R. Jones (AKA “JRJ”) and I’m the **Chief Technology Officer at 
[Virtual Neural, LLC](https://virtualneural.net)**, a stealth-mode startup that's 
exploring the intersection between spatial computing (VR/AR/MR) and Artificial
Intelligence. 

Before Virtual Neural, I was the **Group Product Manager** for the Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service. Before that, I was on the [**Adobe Primetime**](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/primetime.html) team working on video compression, security & cryptography, and Virtual Reality product strategy. 

I live with my wife **Rachel** and my dog Loki in Pleasant Grove, UT (I was raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, and spent most of my adult life in Seattle.)

Prior to Adobe, I worked at [**Microsoft**](http://microsoft.com) on security, cryptography, and incident response for products ranging from Windows to XBox (and even Zune!). Before that, I worked in an assortment of startups: some wildly successful, some dismal failures, all were a blast!

**This site is my personal blog.** It’s primarily about technology and the future, and security/privacy. However, since this is a personal blog I reserve the right to stray from these topics on a regular basis… basically whatever I’m passionate about at the moment that isn’t related to my work. 

I post infrequently and inconsistently.
