# blog.jrj.org Jekyll static site

This is the source repository for [the new jrjBlog](http://blog.jrj.org), which is used to generate a static site using Jekyll.

More detail on the site's design, deployment, and roadmap [can be found on the wiki](https://github.com/jrjones/blog.jrj.org/wiki).

## posts
The posts in the `_posts` directory were imported from my old WordPress installation, and I am in the process of cleaning them up and normalizing them. 

## template
Currently using a slightly modified version of [Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) template by Phlow.

# Conventions

** Categories: ** One per post unless necessary, capitalized.

** Tags: ** As many as needed, lower-case unless proper noun or internal cap (i.e. `iPhone`)
