# org.jrj.blog-staticSite
This is the source repository for the new jrjBlog, which is used to generate a static site.

## posts
The posts in the `_posts` directory were imported from my old WordPress installation, and I am in the process of cleaning them up and normalizing them. 

## template
For now, I am just doing minor tweaks to the default jekyll template, but over time I will do something more custom.

## Priorities

Top priority is getting URLs consistent with old site (don't want to break a bunch of links and search entries.)

Low priority is getting linkblog post type set up. That will be relatively straight forward, but it can be done later if needed.

# Conventions

** Categories: ** One per post unless absolutely necessary, capitalized.

** Tags: ** As many as needed, lower-case unless proper noun or internal cap (i.e. `iPhone`)

# blog.jrj.org Source Repository

This will be the new home of the [blog.jrj.org][1] source code. Currently, it's hosted in git-flavored [VisualStudio Team Services][2], but I plan to migrate it to GitHub.

Once the migration is completed, this readme file will go away.
