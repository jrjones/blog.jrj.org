A friend of mine recently asked me a question about an audiobook service I use, saying "I saw your post on Facebook." Since I hadn't posted on Facebook about this service, I was curious. Turns out this was a "social ad" on Facebook. Facebook used my name and face in a paid advertisement. I'm not comfortable with this, but Facebook makes it easy (though hidden) to turn it off.
